Microcystin/Nodularin concentration as measured by the Abraxis polyclonal \"ADDA\" enzyme-linked immunosorbentassay (ELISA) (PN: 520011) reported to represent the sum of all cross-reactive ADDA bearing molecules from both intracellular and dissolved phases within a sample.  Samples were lysed by three 
sequential freeze/thaw cycles and filtered before analyses.  The assay is capable of detecting both microcystins and nodularins, however, nodularins are considered to be predominately found in brackish waters.  As a result response for these results will be discussed in terms of microcystins, but in a rare cases nodularin has been measured in inland freshwaters."
